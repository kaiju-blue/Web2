                            When you buy native foods, you put money into the hands of First Nations Australians and their communities, including some of the most remote communities on Earth. Some of these communities also have the biggest wealth disparities in the country, so funding native food businesses has a very real impact in the regions.
                        <p>
                            Perhaps one of the biggest social impacts of buying and using native foods is establishing a culture of respect for native Australian plants and animals, and the First Nations peoples who have relied on them. Normalising native foods means making them more widely accessible, and this has the added benefit of making traditional food and culture more accessible to First Nations Australians. It also lets traditional food stand out as just as legitimate as Western food; "bush" food has often had the connotation of being lesser, but it has helped to sustain First Nations Australians for eons. If we recognise native foods as legitimately good and nourishing foods, they will continue to support the population of Australia into the drying future.

                            <div><p id="planettext">On top of the benefits for people, a move towards native food plants provides several improvements for the local Australian environment. This comes from the long-established roles of such plants in the land's evolution over millions of years. Through eons of development, these plants have established themselves to be hardy and resourceful, and thus are a great small-resource option for food compared to traditional Western crops.</p></div>
                            <div class="inserts2">
                                <div><p id="textinsert1">Native crops often provide shelters and food for native animals, such as pollen and nectar, which allows for those species to flourish. Native crops are also often farmed in small-scale farms or wild-picked, rather than grown as monocultures. This can help lead to an increase in biodiversity, a necessity to counteract global insect populations plummeting in recent years.
		 
                                    They are also evolved to be pollinated by native animals, which reduces the need for farmers to move in for-hire pollinators.</p></div>
                                <div><p id="textinsert2">Native crops grown in their native rangers are better adapted to local climates and soil conditions, and this also often means they are adapted to local rainfall. This can mean some crops need little supplemental watering! In a drier climate such as Australia's, reducing water use in any way is crucial. 
		
                                    Less intensive watering also means less chemical runoff making its way into groundwater and waterways from the soil. This runoff can make animals sick, and can fuel algae blooms that suffocate rivers and kill native wildlife and flora.</p></div>
                                <div><p id="textinsert3">Hand-picked produce reduces the impact of heavy machinery on fragile soils, including the degradation of topsoil.
		
                                    Since natives are adjusted to lower quality soils and pests, less fertiliser and pesticides end up being used. This reduces the chemical load in the soil.</p></div>
                                <div><p id="textinsert4">Local produce produces less CO2 emissions due to less transit.
		
                                    Eating in-season food reduces the resources needed to store produce for extended periods, such as via refrigeration. As long as our power is fuelled by carbon-producing fossil-fuels, electricity from food storage contributes to a food's carbon footprint!
                                    
                                    With a warming climate, native plants will become a necessity as more resources are needed to maintain non-native crops.</p></div>
